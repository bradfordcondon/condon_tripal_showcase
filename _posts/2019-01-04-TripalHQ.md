Tripal HQ provides a user-contributed content control center and administrative toolbox for your Tripal site. This means that users are able to create whatever Chado content youâ€™d like them, but withhold inserting it into the database until someone has approved it.

Please see the [full documentation here](https://tripal-hq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

HQ also provides a Chado-specific permission (currently only supporting organisms). If you have lots of organisms on your site, and want to allow users to be the admin of a specific organism or set of organisms, this feature is for you!


- Users create data using your existing Bundle configuration- no extra forms!
- User dashboard area for viewing pending submissions
- Admin dashboard for viewing submissions
- Chado-based permissions to create admins for certain projects or organisms
